# (PATCHED) Share-Bot
Automated TikTok share bot in python

I did not make this, all credits to the repl.it user @EasyGlumRedundant. Moved this over to Githhub as it's much easier to get.

Usage

Python 3.6 or above is required.  
I develop for Windows machines only and do not intentionally support other operating systems. 
If you do not already have the requests library installed, run setup.py — make sure PIP is added to PATH. 

Run main.py.                                                                                                                                                                          Enter the amount of desired Shares.                                                                                                                                                                       Paste a TikTok video URL — e.g. https://www.tiktok.com/@username/video/1234567891234567891.                                                                                                                                                                        All set!
